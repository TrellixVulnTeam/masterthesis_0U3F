__label__negative from pep 333 : servers and gateways that implement http 11 must provide transparent support for http 11s expect/continue mechanism this may be done in any of several ways : 1 respond to requests containing an expect : 100-continue request with an immediate 100 continue response , and proceed normally 2 proceed with the request normally , but provide the application with a wsgiinput stream that will send the 100 continue response if/when the application first attempts to read from the input stream the read request must then remain blocked until the client responds 3 wait until the client decides that the server does not support expect/continue , and sends the request body on its own this is suboptimal , and is not recommended we used to do 3 , but are now doing 1 maybe well do 2 someday , but it seems like it would be a big slowdown for such a rare case
