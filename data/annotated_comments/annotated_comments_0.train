__label__negative note : psycopg2 is unable to differentiate between exceptions thrown by stored procedures and certain other database internal exceptions , thus we do not know if the exception in question is raised from our stored procedure or from some other error in addition , postgresql is unable to pass any error code for the exception and so the only thing which we can look at is the actual text string exceptions raised by our stored procedures will all start with an error code followed by a colon , which separates the error code from the text string that follows next if the error text does not follow this format it is likely not one of our exceptions and so we throw and log a more general exception

__label__negative from pep 333 : servers and gateways that implement http 11 must provide transparent support for http 11s expect/continue mechanism this may be done in any of several ways : 1 respond to requests containing an expect : 100-continue request with an immediate 100 continue response , and proceed normally 2 proceed with the request normally , but provide the application with a wsgiinput stream that will send the 100 continue response if/when the application first attempts to read from the input stream the read request must then remain blocked until the client responds 3 wait until the client decides that the server does not support expect/continue , and sends the request body on its own this is suboptimal , and is not recommended we used to do 3 , but are now doing 1 maybe well do 2 someday , but it seems like it would be a big slowdown for such a rare case
