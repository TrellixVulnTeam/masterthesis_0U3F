__label__negative with create_network called below , the same request comes as notification and it will be processed in the create_network_event the request should not be processed as it is already processed here the only way to decide whether it is for a new network or not is the segmentation_id dcnm does not have uuid for network which is unique for that reason it is needed to send segmentation_id when creating network in openstack moreover , we are using network_type=local and for that reason provider : segmentation_id can not be added as parameter when creating network one solution is to embed segmentation_id in the network name then , when processing the notification , if the request is from dcnm , the segmentation_id will be extracted from network name with that create_network_event can decide to process or deny an event
